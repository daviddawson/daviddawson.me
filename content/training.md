## Technical Training That Makes a Difference

I deliver practical, hands-on training that helps development teams level up their skills in distributed systems and modern architecture patterns. My approach focuses on real-world application rather than academic theory - you'll leave with knowledge you can apply immediately.

### Available Training Courses

#### Microservices Architecture Fundamentals
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Format**: On-site or remote

Learn how to design, build, and operate microservices architectures that actually work in production.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Service boundary identification using Domain-Driven Design
- Communication patterns: REST, messaging, and event streaming
- Data management strategies and the perils of distributed transactions
- Service discovery, load balancing, and resilience patterns
- Testing strategies for distributed systems
- Operational concerns: monitoring, tracing, and debugging

**Who Should Attend**: Software developers and architects moving from monolithic to microservices architectures.

#### Event-Driven Architecture Workshop
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Format**: On-site or remote

Master the patterns and practices of building truly reactive, event-driven systems.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Designing event schemas and evolution strategies
- Building event processing pipelines
- Handling eventual consistency
- Error handling and compensation patterns
- Using Kafka, EventStore, and other event streaming platforms

**Who Should Attend**: Teams building or maintaining event-driven systems.

#### Groovy & Grails Development
**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Format**: On-site or remote

From Java developer to Groovy expert - learn how to leverage Groovy's power for rapid application development.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Groovy language fundamentals and idioms
- Metaprogramming and DSL creation
- Grails framework deep dive
- GORM and data access patterns
- Testing with Spock
- Building RESTful APIs with Grails
- Performance optimization techniques

**Who Should Attend**: Java developers looking to increase productivity with Groovy and Grails.

#### Distributed Systems Design Patterns
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Format**: On-site or remote

Understand the fundamental patterns that make distributed systems work reliably at scale.

**What You'll Learn**:
- CAP theorem and its practical implications
- Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos basics)
- Distributed data patterns: sharding, replication, partitioning
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts
- Building for failure: chaos engineering principles

**Who Should Attend**: Developers and architects working on distributed systems.

### Custom Training

I also develop custom training programs tailored to your team's specific needs and technology stack. Whether you're adopting Kubernetes, implementing event sourcing, or migrating to microservices, I can create a program that addresses your unique challenges.

### Training Philosophy

My training approach is based on:

**Hands-On Learning**: We'll build real systems, not just look at slides. Expect to write code, break things, and fix them.

**Real-World Focus**: Every pattern and practice is illustrated with examples from actual production systems, including war stories of what went wrong.

**Interactive Sessions**: Questions and discussions are encouraged. The best learning happens when we challenge assumptions.

**Practical Takeaways**: You'll leave with working code examples, reference architectures, and decision frameworks you can use immediately.

### What Others Say

> "David's microservices training transformed how our team thinks about system design. We went from a tangled mess of services to a well-structured architecture in just a few months." - *Tech Lead, Financial Services*

> "The event-driven architecture workshop was exactly what we needed. David helped us understand not just the 'how' but more importantly the 'why' and 'when'." - *CTO, E-commerce Startup*

> "Best technical training I've attended. Perfect balance of theory and hands-on practice." - *Senior Developer, Logistics Company*

### Logistics

**Group Size**: 6-20 participants for optimal interaction  
**Location**: On-site at your offices or remote via video conferencing  
**Materials**: All participants receive comprehensive course materials, code examples, and reference implementations  
**Follow-up**: One month of email support included for questions that arise during implementation
