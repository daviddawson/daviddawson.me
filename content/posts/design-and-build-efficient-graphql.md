I've been working with the team at Aurena in Austria since the beginning of 2021. It's been a lot of fun, and interesting work.

## The Journey with Aurena

Working with Aurena has been an exciting journey in helping them digitize their distribution process. As part of this effort, I built two microservices using Apollo Federation that form a critical part of their GraphQL API infrastructure.

## Identifying Performance Issues

During development, we identified significant performance issues in our GraphQL API design. Using Elastic APM, we were able to analyze and pinpoint inefficient database queries that were impacting our API response times.

## The N+1 Query Problem

One of the key challenges we discovered was the classic N+1 query problem, where our GraphQL resolvers were making excessive database queries for related data. This is a common issue in GraphQL implementations where each field resolver triggers separate database queries.

## Implementing DataLoaders

To solve this problem, we integrated DataLoaders into our GraphQL architecture. DataLoaders provide a batching and caching layer between your GraphQL server and data sources, dramatically reducing the number of database queries needed to fulfill a GraphQL request.

## Results and Impact

The improvements were significant:
- Reduced database query count
- Improved API response times
- Better system scalability
- Maintained flexibility for future development

## Making APIs More Extensible

Beyond performance, we focused on making our APIs more extensible. This involved:
- Designing flexible schema structures
- Implementing proper separation of concerns
- Creating reusable resolver patterns
- Building with future requirements in mind

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several key principles for building efficient GraphQL APIs:
1. Always monitor and profile your API performance
2. Be proactive about addressing N+1 query problems
3. Use tools like DataLoaders to optimize data fetching
4. Design for extensibility from the start
5. Keep your system flexible for future development needs
